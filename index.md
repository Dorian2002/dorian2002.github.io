Hi and welcome to my portfolio, here you can read about one of my passions : **software programming**. You can check down below if you want to know more about my personnality otherwise jump directly into my [projects](https://LienProjets).

I have interests in far too many subjects, though my favourite ones are for sure **Tech**, **Physics**, **Video Games** and of course **Programming**. But I'm always glad to spend time singing, listening music and also reading about ecology, geopolitics or finance.
 
Let's talk more specifically about programming. My skills range from **video game** development to **web** development, my main langages are **C++** and **C#** and what I prefer to do is **code architecture**. I have 2 years of professional experience in **.Net web tool development** in banking, basics in **game engine** programming and I'm comfortable with **tooling** and **gameplay**. When it comes to finding solutions to problems I can be very **resourceful and creative**. Also I like **clean and readable code** which is why i make sure mine is too.

Now, you might be wondering what kind of programmer i am. Always **ready to help** I can make myself **available** when needed. I have a very good ability to **explain my work** and **present it to other trades** thanks to my experience with web tools in banking. I'm very comfortable **working as part of a team** and getting to **grips with work methods**. Still, I'm very discret and I know I have many efforts to do in socializing at work.
